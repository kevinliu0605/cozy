## Cozy

### App Description

Cozy is a community property management system that contains features including:

* Dash Board – designed to announce upcoming events, alert, monthly newsletter and condo policy
* Discuss Board – designed for resident to post anecdotes, concerns or whatever they want, for example like, I found the light in lower garage is out of work
* Chat Thread – designed for trustee to communicate instead of using email thread, the idea is coming from slack
* Calendar Schedule – designed to book common room, reserve maintain service for the condo, such as dumpster clean, garage clean, fire alarm testing, or elevator inspection, etc.
* Payment Tool – designed to pay condo fee, common room reserve fee (but here we should concern about the data safety and privacy issue)
